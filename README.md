# Known Issues and Compatibility

# Fonts, Icon Fonts, and Dependencies
* [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) are used at various weights, but are not included in this repository. Please follow the links to download the fonts onto your computer.

# Paper Size/Orientation
* Currently letter portrait only. PRs welcome for other paper sizes --- especially A4!

# Actually Generating the PDF
* Again...I've only tried on the said version of Firefox & Chrome, on OS X.
* On Firefox:
  * You probably need to remove any page margins in **about:config**.
  * Uncheck **Ignore Scaling and Shrink To Fit Page Width**.
  * Check **Print Background Images**.
  * Clear out the headers and footers.
* On Google Chrome:
  * Set **Margin** to **None**.
  * Print **Background Graphics**.
  * Don't print headers and footers.

# Footnotes and License
* If you ever print out the generated PDF, make sure texts are not clipped off, or items have not unexpectedly shrunk. Additionally, since the PDF has no margin outside the shaded sidebar and most printers have a no-print area, the shaded sidebar probably won't fill up to the edge of the page when printed.

* Feel free to remove the ``#disclaimer`` block which links back to this repository --- but huge thanks if you decide to keep it.
* This project uses fonts from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). The layout/design inspired by Paolo Zupin (if anyone knows which link I should put under Mr. Zupin's name, please tell me!)
